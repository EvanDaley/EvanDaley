### Hi there, I am Evan!

I'm an experienced developer, leader and architect working remotely from the Pacific Northwest.

At
[Kaspien](https://www.kaspien.com/software/)
I helped develop Saas systems that drive over **1B** in sales. At
[Two Barrels](https://www.twobarrels.com/)
I'm building software that has helped create over **1M** companies in the US. 
During weekends at 
[Nucamp](https://www.nucamp.co/)
I've led over 60 workshops, instructing students on the basics and best practices of MERN software development.


My main focus these days is fullstack software development, primarly for Saas-driven businesses.
I love building digital experiences, working with big data, and solving complex challenges.
My strongest proficiencies right now are React, Rails, Vue, AWS, docker, and sql -
but I invest a lot of time in learning other stacks and I've worked with quite a few professionally.


Please follow me on Github and drop me a line at daley.evan@gmail.com.
