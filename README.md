### Hi there, I am Evan!

I love creating software and solving complex challenges.
My strongest proficiencies are Laravel, Rails, Vue, AWS, React docker, and anything sql -
but I've worked with quite a few other stacks professionally.


At
[Kaspien](https://www.kaspien.com/software/)
I helped develop Saas systems that have driven over **1B** in sales. At
[Two Barrels](https://www.twobarrels.com/)
our software has already helped form/incorporate **1M** companies in the US. 


Right now my primary focus is leading fullstack software teams for Saas-driven companies.

<!-- During weekends at [Nucamp](https://www.nucamp.co/) I've led over 60 workshops, instructing students on the basics and best practices of MERN software development. -->
