### Hi there, I am Evan!

Hi, I'm Evan Daley. I'm an experienced developer, leader and architect. 
I fell in love with programming at a pretty young age and have pursued it diligently for the last fifteen years.

I've had the privilege of working for a few really cool tech companies in the Pacific Northwest.
At 
[Kaspien](https://www.kaspien.com/software/)
our Saas systems drove over *1B* in sales.
At 
[Two Barrels](https://www.twobarrels.com/)
our software has helped create over *1M* companies in the US. 
During weekends at 
[Nucamp](https://www.nucamp.co/)
I've led over 60 workshops, instructing students on the basics and best practices of MERN software development.


My main focus these days is fullstack software development, primarly for Saas-driven businesses.
I love building digital experiences, working with big data, and solving complex challenges.
My strongest proficiencies right now are React, Rails, Vue, AWS, docker, and sql -
but I invest a lot of time in learning other stacks and I've worked with quite a few professionally.
